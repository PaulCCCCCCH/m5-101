The `m5-101` is generated by running `mkdocs build` or `mkdocs serve`. You don't need to change anything in that folder.
You can place `.md` or `.ipynb` files in `docs/content`, and modify the related element in `schedule.md`. Whenever you are not sure what to do, please look at the code that is up and running for examples, or contact the owner of the repo directly.
